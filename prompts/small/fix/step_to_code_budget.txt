spent += 30*3*5*3
# Add accommodation price (100 per night per person for 4 nights and 3 people) to spent

# Based on the examples above, in which the lines start with '#' is the instuction, where the line/lines below it before the next '#' is the corresponding code.
# For this below instruction, write corresponding code and respond instruction with code only. Start with ########## Budget response########## and end with ########## Budget response ends##########.
