# Based on the examples above, in which the lines start with '#' is the instuction, where the line/lines below it before the next '#' is the corresponding code.
# For this below instruction, write corresponding code and respond instruction with code only. Start with ########## Destination cities response########## and end with ########## Destination cities response ends##########.
