Please assist me in extracting valid information from a given natural language text and reconstructing it in JSON format, as demonstrated in the following example.
In the input JSON, "org" denotes the departure city. "dest" denotes the destination city/cities. "days" denotes the total number of travel days. "date" includes the specific date to visit.
In addition, "local_constraint" contains three possible constraints. "flight rule" specifies the whether "non-stop" is required or not. "airlines" specifies a list of a airlines you can accept. Possible options of "attraction_category" specifies a list of categories of attractions want to visit. If the field value is null in JSON, this specific hard constraint is not included. 
The specified "flight rule" needs to be satisfied by all flights. All flights need to be one of the accepted "airlines". All categories in "attraction_category" needs to be satisfied, and a category could be satisfied if it exists for one attraction. 
Here are three examples: 
-----EXAMPLE 1-----
