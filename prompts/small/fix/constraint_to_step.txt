You are given a constraint to satisfy for a travel plan problem in JSON format. 
In the input JSON, "org" denotes the departure city. "dest" denotes the destination city/cities. "days" denotes the total number of travel days. "date" includes the specific date to visit.
In addition, "local_constraint" contains three possible constraints. "flight rule" specifies the whether "non-stop" is required or not. "airlines" specifies a list of a airlines you can accept. Possible options of "attraction_category" specifies a list of categories of attractions want to visit. If the field value is null in JSON, this specific hard constraint is not included. 
The specified "flight rule" needs to be satisfied by all flights. All flights need to be one of the accepted "airlines". All categories in "attraction_category" needs to be satisfied, and a category could be satisfied if it exists for one attraction. 
Your job is to give a detailed step by step instuction to encode this constraint as code. 
Here are some example steps for different constraint:
-----EXAMPLE 1-----
JSON Constraint:
{
    "org": "Hong Kong", 
    "dest": ["New York City", "Bangkok"], 
    "days": 5, 
    "visiting_city_number": 2, 
    "date": ["2023-12-24", "2023-12-25", "2023-12-26", "2023-12-27", "2023-12-28"], 
    "people_number": 3, 
    "local_constraint": {
        "flight rule": "non-stop", 
        "airlines": ["United", "Emirates"], 
        "attraction_category": ["Garden", "Historical landmark"]
    }, 
    "budget": 5000
}
Steps:
# Destination cities # 
# Set cities to be a list includes "New York City" and "Bangkok"
# Loop through cities for 2 destination cities
# Initialize Z3 solver s
# Set 'city' variable to be indexes of 2 destination cities
# If city_0_index and city_1_index are not same, assert 2 'city' variables equal to city index

# Departure dates # 
# Set 'departure_dates' variables for 3 transportations between cities
# Assert first transportation happens at first day (day 0), last transportation happens at last day (day 4), and second transportation could happen at any day in between

# Flight information # 
# Run FlightSearch to get flight info for "Hong Kong" as origin, city_0 and city_1, and dates
# Get specific flight price info with "Hong Kong" as origin and final destination, specific city variable, and departure date for 3 transportations
# Set 'flight_index' variable for 3 transportations
# Assert 3 'flight_index' variables are within valid range
# Calculate flight price for 3 people for 3 transportations based on flight index variable
# Get specific flight arrival time info with "Hong Kong" as origin and final destination, specific city, and departure date for 3 transportations
# Calculate flight arrival time for 3 transportations based on flight index variable
# Initialize visit city list for "Hong Kong" as origin and final destination, and other 2 cities in between
# For each 'flight_index', get specific flight rule and airline info based on visit city and departure date, assert non-stop is satisfied, and either "United" or "Emirates" is satisfied

# Attraction information # 
# Get arrivals and city list for each day based on 3 transportations, 5 total travel day, and departure dates variables
# Run AttractionSearch to get attraction info for city_0 and city_1, record attractions with categories Garden and Historical landmark
# Set 'attraction_in_which_city' variables for 5 (1 per day) attractions
# For each 'attraction_in_which_city' variable, assert it to be either current city or next city based on transportation arrivals time
# Set 'attraction_index' variables for 5 (1 per day) attractions
# For each 'attraction_index', get specific length info based on attraction in which city variable, assert index are within valid range, and attrations in same city are not repeated
# Set 'attraction_category' variables for each attraction category required
# For each attraction_category type in ["Garden", "Historical landmark"], iterate through all attractions to check if it is satisfied

# Budget # 
# Set budget limit variable to be 1000
# Add 3 flight price to spent
# Add restaurant price (30 per meal per person for 3*5 meals and 3 people) to spent
# Add accommodation price (100 per night per person for 4 nights and 3 people) to spent
# Assert current spent is within budget
