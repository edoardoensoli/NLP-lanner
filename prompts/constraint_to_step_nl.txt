You are given a natural language query that contains important constraints to satisfy for a travel plan problem. These constraints could include departure city, destination state or city, total travel days and dates, and some spcecial requirements regarding accommodation, restaurant, and transportation. 
Your job is to give a detailed step by step instuction to encode this constraint as code. 
Here are some example steps for different constraint:
-----EXAMPLE 1-----
Natural Language query:
