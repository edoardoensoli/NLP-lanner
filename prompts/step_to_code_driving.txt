# Based on the examples above, in which the lines start with '#' is the instuction, where the line/lines below it before the next '#' is the corresponding code.
# Follow the variable names and code structure in examples. Strictly use 'driving_i_arrtime'(where i is a int representing the index, for example driving_0_arrtime, driving_2_arrtime) as variable name to record driving arrival time. DO NOT use different customized variable name in any case. Do not use for loops.
# For this below instruction, write corresponding code and respond instruction with code only. Start with ########## Driving response########## and end with ########## Driving response ends##########.
