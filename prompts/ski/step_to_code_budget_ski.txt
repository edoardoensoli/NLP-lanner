# Python script for testing satisfiability of the budget constraint for a ski resort plan problem.

# Set budget limit variable to be 5000 (example value, can be adjusted based on query)
variables['budget_limit'] = RealVal(5000)

# Add ski pass costs to spent, calculated per person per day
spent = 0
spent += variables['people'] * variables['days'] * ski_pass_price

# Add equipment rental costs to spent, calculated per person per day
spent += variables['equipment_people'] * variables['days'] * equipment_rental_price

# Add car rental costs to spent, calculated per day
spent += variables['days'] * car_rental_price

# Add accommodation costs to spent, calculated per person per day
spent += variables['people'] * variables['days'] * accommodation_price

# Assert current spent is within budget
s.assert_and_track(spent <= variables['budget_limit'], 'budget enough')

# Based on the examples above, in which the lines start with '#' is the instruction, where the line/lines below it before the next '#' is the corresponding code.
# Follow the examples to use the correct Z3 syntax. Do not use for loop to add costs.
# For this below instruction, write corresponding code and respond instruction with code only. Start with ########## Budget response########## and end with ########## Budget response ends##########.
