# Based on the examples above, in which the lines start with '#' is the instruction, where the line/lines below it before the next '#' is the corresponding code.
# Follow the code structure variable names in examples
# For this below instruction, write corresponding code and respond instruction with code only. Start with ########## Destination response########## and end with ########## Destination response ends##########.
