You are given a natural language query for ski resort planning. Your job is to give detailed step-by-step instructions to encode these constraints as code for a ski planning system.

Here are the available ski resort services:
- SkiResorts: accommodation with beds, prices, access methods, and ratings
- SkiSlopes: slope information with difficulty levels, total slopes, and longest runs
- SkiRent: equipment rental (Skis, Boots, Helmet, Poles) with daily prices
- SkiCar: car rental (SUV, Sedan, Pick up, Cabriolet) with different fuel types and daily prices
